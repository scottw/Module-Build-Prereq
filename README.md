Module-Build-Prereq
===================

Perl module to naÃ¯vely analyze your module dependencies and then make
sure they're properly listed in your Makefile.PL.

## INSTALLATION ##

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

## USAGE ##

Use in your `Makefile.PL`:

    use Module::Build::Prereq;

    my %prereq_pm = (Foo => '1.2',
                     Bar => '2.2a');

    assert_modules(\%prereq_pm);

    WriteMakefile(PREREQ_PM => \%prereq_pm, ...);

`assert_modules` should not be added to any `Makefile.PL` which is
part of a publicly available module (unless you want your module users
to have another needless dependency); it is meant to help a) during
development of any module and b) any time you need to ensure you
deploy with the correct dependencies.
